# Flex Cables for V9-V12 PS2


Why? In an attempt to curb piracy, $ony designed the laser to fail and burn up. Sadly this [backfired](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-reaches-settlement-in-ps2-disc-read-error-case#:~:text=Now%20a%20settlement%20has%20been,their%20console%20%2D%20at%20SCEA's%20discretion.)

Invented by the Matrix Team, they designed a cheap and easy fix for V9-V12 PS2s, documented [here](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn/blob/master/docs/PICfix.md) and refined by HaloSlayer255 and [ModzvillUSA](https://modzvilleusa.com/products/ps2-matrix-picfix-for-v9-v12-ps2-consoles)


I (R3Z3N) simply applied some artistic touch to make this an easier install that will look professional with decent soldering skills. CLEAN YOUR FLUX BOYS!

If your PS2 is the following model with the circutry in red, you DO NOT NEED THIS FIX!
